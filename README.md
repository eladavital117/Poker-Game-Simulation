# Poker Game Simulation

## Overview

This project is a C++ application designed to simulate and analyze poker hands. It performs Monte Carlo simulations to compare two poker hands across a specified number of games. The simulation uses multithreading to handle large numbers of games efficiently, providing statistical insights into the relative strengths of the poker hands.

## Project Files
The project consists of the following files:

1. **PokerGame.h**: Contains the definition of the PokerGame class, including methods for initializing the simulation, generating random poker hands, evaluating hand strengths, and printing card details.

2. **PokerGame.cpp**: Implements the methods defined in PokerGame.h. This includes the core logic for simulating games, creating and managing threads, and evaluating poker hands.

3. **main.cpp**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the poker hands, initializes the PokerGame class, and runs the simulation. It also measures and outputs the time taken for the simulation.

## Key Features
- **Simulation of Poker Games**: Simulates a large number of poker games between two predefined hands.

- **Multithreading**: Utilizes multiple threads to parallelize the simulation process, significantly reducing computation time for large numbers of games.

- **Hand Evaluation**: Includes comprehensive logic for evaluating poker hands based on standard poker rules, including flushes, straights, and full houses.

- **Card Generation**: Randomly generates the remaining cards in the deck for each game, ensuring a fair and unbiased simulation.

- **Statistical Output**: Provides percentages of wins for each hand and draws, offering insights into the relative strength of the hands.

## Usage
In 'main.cpp', you can adjust the following parameters:
- **'GAME_COUNT'**: The number of games to simulate. set to 1,000,000 by default
- **'THREAD_COUNT'**: The number of threads to use for parallel processing. Set to 8 by default.
- **'const int hand1[2][2]'**, **'const int hand2[2][2]'**: The poker hands to be simulated against each other. represeting hands [14♥, 13♥], [2♠, 2♥] by default.
Modify these values as needed
